# Inventory Planning Excel Model

This repository contains an Excel-based inventory planning model implementing fundamental inventory management concepts to support operational inventory policy decisions.

## Purpose
The model is designed to translate demand assumptions and variability into practical inventory policies, including how much to order and when to reorder, under real-world uncertainty.

## What the model includes
- Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) calculations
- Safety stock estimation based on demand variability and lead time
- Reorder point (ROP) logic
- Clear separation between inputs, calculations, and outputs
- A reference sheet explaining assumptions and formulas

## Intended use
This model is designed for educational and decision-support purposes. It is suitable for small to medium-scale planning scenarios where transparency and interpretability are prioritized. The model prioritizes transparency and interpretability over algorithmic complexity.

## Limitations
- The model is not automated or optimized for large-scale production use
- Results depend on the quality and assumptions of demand and lead-time inputs
- External constraints such as supplier capacity limits or dynamic pricing are not explicitly modeled

## Related work
This project complements a demand forecasting model that focuses on estimating demand uncertainty and forecast error, which serve as inputs to inventory policy decisions.
